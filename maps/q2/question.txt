Assignment
It's important to keep up with privacy regulations and to respect our user's data. We need a function that will delete user records.

Complete the deleteIfNecessary function.

Check the scheduledForDeletion bool to determine if they are scheduled for deletion or not.

If the user doesn't exist in the map, return the error not found.
If they exist but aren't scheduled for deletion, return deleted as false with no errors.
If they exist and are scheduled for deletion, return deleted as true with no errors and delete their record from the map.

	number               int
