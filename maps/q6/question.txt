Assignment
Complete the findSuggestedFriends function. It takes a username string, and a friendships map as inputs. 
The map keys are usernames, and the values are slices of strings representing the direct friends of that user.

Example friendship map:
friendships := map[string][]string{
    "Alice":   {"Bob", "Charlie"},
    "Bob":     {"Alice", "Charlie", "David"},
    "Charlie": {"Alice", "Bob", "David", "Eve"},
    "David":   {"Bob", "Charlie"},
    "Eve":     {"Charlie"},
}

The function should return a slice of strings containing the user's suggested friends. A suggested friend is someone who is not a direct friend of the user but is a direct friend of one or more of the user's direct friends. Each suggested friend should appear only once in the slice, even if they are found through multiple direct friends.

If there are no suggested friends, return a nil slice.

For example using the friendships map above:
suggestedFriends := findSuggestedFriends("Alice", friendships)
// suggestedFriends = [David, Eve]
//--------------------------------------------------------
package main

func findSuggestedFriends(username string, friendships map[string][]string) []string {
	// ?
}
