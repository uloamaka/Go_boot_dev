Assignment
We want to be able to send emails in batches. A writing goroutine will write an entire batch of email messages to a buffered channel, and later, once the channel is full, a reading goroutine will read all of the messages from the channel and send them out to our clients.

Complete the addEmailsToQueue function. It should create a buffered channel with a buffer large enough to store all of the emails it's given. It should then write the emails to the channel in order, and finally return the channel.

package main

func addEmailsToQueue(emails []string) chan string {
