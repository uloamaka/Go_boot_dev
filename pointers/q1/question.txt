Assignment
Fix the bug in the getMessageText function.
It's supposed to return a nicely formatted message to the console containing an SMS's recipient and message body.
However, it's not working as expected. Run the code and see what happens, then fix the bug.
//------------------------------------------------------------------
import "fmt"

type Message struct {
	Recipient string
	Text      string
}

func getMessageText(m Message) string {
	return fmt.Sprintf(`
To: %v
Message: %v
`, &m.Recipient, &m.Text)
}
