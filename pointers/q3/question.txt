Assignment
Write a getMessageText function. It should accept a pointer to an Analytics struct and a Message struct (not a pointer).

It should look at the Success field of the Message struct and, based on that, 
increment the MessagesTotal, MessagesSucceeded, 
or MessagesFailed fields of the Analytics struct as appropriate.

	MessagesFailed    int
	MessagesSucceeded int
}

type Message struct {
	Recipient string
	Success   bool
}
