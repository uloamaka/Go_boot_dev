Our users frequently try to run custom analytics queries on their message deliverability metrics, and end up writing a bad query that tries to divide a number by zero. It's become such a problem that we need to make a new type of error for division by zero.

Update the code so that the divideError type implements the error interface. Its Error() method should just return a string formatted in the following way:

can not divide DIVIDEND by zero

Where DIVIDEND is the actual dividend of the divideError. Use the %v verb to format the dividend as a float.

//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type divideError struct {
	dividend float64
}

// ?

func divide(dividend, divisor float64) (float64, error) {
	if divisor == 0 {
		return 0, divideError{dividend: dividend}
	}
	return dividend / divisor, nil
}
