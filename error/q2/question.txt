Assignment

We need better error logs for our backend developers to help them debug their code.

Complete the getSMSErrorString() function. It should return a string with this format:

SMS that costs $COST to be sent to 'RECIPIENT' can not be sent

COST is the cost of the SMS, always showing the price formatted to 2 decimal places.
RECIPIENT is the stringified representation of the recipient's phone number
Be sure to include the $ symbol and the single quotes

func getSMSErrorString(cost float64, recipient string) string {
	// ?
}
