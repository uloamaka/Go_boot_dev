Assignment
As an Easter egg, we decided to reward our users with a free text message if they send a prime number of text messages this year.

Complete the printPrimes function. It should print all of the prime numbers up to and including max. It should skip any numbers that are not prime.

Here's the pseudocode:
printPrimes(max):
  for n in range(2, max+1):
    if n is 2:
      n is prime, print it
    if n is even:
      n is not prime, skip to next n
    for i in range (3, sqrt(n), 2):
      if i can be multiplied into n:
        n is not prime, skip to next n
    n is prime, print it
