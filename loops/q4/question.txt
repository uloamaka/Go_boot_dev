We're hiring engineers at Textio, so time to brush up on the classic "Fizzbuzz" game, a coding exercise that has been dramatically overused in coding interviews across the world.

Complete the fizzbuzz function that prints the numbers 1 to 100 inclusive each on their own line, but replace multiples of 3 with the text fizz and multiples of 5 with buzz. Print fizzbuzz for multiples of 3 AND 5.

Note: This lesson is graded based on the output of your program, so don't leave any debugging print statements in your code.
