Assignment
Complete the countConnections function that takes an integer groupSize representing 
the number of people in the group chat and returns an integer representing 
the number of connections between them.
For each additional person in the group, the number of new connections continues to grow. 
Use a for loop to accumulate the number of connections instead of directly using a mathematical formula.
