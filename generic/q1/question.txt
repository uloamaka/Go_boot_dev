Assignment
At Mailio we store all the emails for a campaign in memory as a slice. We store payments for a single user in the same way.

Complete the getLast() function. It should be a generic function that returns the last element from a slice, no matter the types stored in the slice. If the slice is empty, it should return the zero value of the type.

package main

func getLast[T any](s []T) T {
	// ?
}
