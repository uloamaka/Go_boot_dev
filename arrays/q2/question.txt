Retries are a premium feature now! Textio's free users only get 1 retry message, while pro members get an unlimited amount.

Complete the getMessageWithRetriesForPlan function. It takes a plan variable as input as well as an array of 3 messages. You've been provided with constants representing the plan types at the top of the file.

If the plan is a pro plan, return all the strings from the messages input in a slice.
If the plan is a free plan, return the first 2 strings from the messages input in a slice.
If the plan isn't either of those, return a nil slice and an error that says unsupported plan.
